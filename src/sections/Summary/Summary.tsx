      I have always loved to try to simplify things. I had managed my own
      business for some years, and everyday I kept thinking, "What can I do to
      make this more efficient?". I taught myself to code to find solutions to
      problems I had within my business. It was then that I realized that this
      was something I wanted to focus on.

      In Rutgers University, I had learned some fundamental concepts to
      programming as well as receiving a little exposure to Java. In 2018, I
      went on complete the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to get some formal training
      in some of the newer technologies such as NodeJS and ReactJS. Coding is an
      ever evolving subject that requires dedication to perpetual learning.
      Because of this constant flow of innovation it leaves so much to study and
      experience.
